# Docker Management Script

This script provides a set of functions for managing Docker containers. It allows users to interact with Docker containers by offering functionalities to start, stop, and restart containers.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting and Docker commands.

## Installation

To use the script, clone or download it to your local machine and ensure it has execute permissions.

```bash
chmod +x docker.sh
```

## Usage

The script includes the following functions:

- `choose_docker_container`: Lists all available Docker containers and allows the user to select one. The selected container's ID is stored for further actions.

- `docker_start`: Starts the selected Docker container. It first invokes `choose_docker_container` to select a container.

- `docker_stop`: Stops the selected Docker container. It first invokes `choose_docker_container` to select a container.

- `docker_restart`: Restarts the selected Docker container. It first invokes `choose_docker_container` to select a container.

To run any of these functions, execute the script followed by the function name:

```bash
./docker.sh docker_start
```

## Note

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute Docker commands.
- The script assumes Docker is installed and configured on your system.

## Todo
- Status Overview: Add a function to display an overview of all containers, including their status (running, exited), ports, images, and creation dates.

- Health Check Functionality: Integrate a health check feature that reports on the health of running containers based on their health status in Docker.

- Search Functionality: Implement a search feature that allows users to find containers based on names, IDs, or other criteria.

- Update Notification: A function to check for the latest Docker images for the containers and suggest or automate updates.

- Backup and Restore: Provide options to easily backup and restore container data, which is crucial for data integrity and recovery.

- Resource Monitoring: Add features to monitor and report on the resource usage (CPU, memory) of each container, which is essential for performance tuning.

- Custom Configuration Management: Allow users to save and manage custom configurations for containers, making it easier to deploy containers with preferred settings.

- Network Management: Include options to manage Docker networks, such as creating, inspecting, and removing networks.

- Security Scans: Integrate with tools to perform security scans on containers and images to ensure they are free of known vulnerabilities.

- User Access Control: Implement user access control to allow different levels of permissions for different users of the script, enhancing security.

- Logging and Audit Trails: Maintain logs of actions performed through the script for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
